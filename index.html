            <small>Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at risk,
                threatened by a high risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are crowded
                into emergency flood shelters. Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats to bring
                relief. Roads and homes have been submerged, power stations are down, and over 380 schools have been
                closed or impacted. </small> <br>
